# PQtree_rs
Check Continous 1's Property of matrix: a fast PQ Tree library for python

## Description
In particular, this library is implemented as a wrapper of [Khitrin's PQ Tree](https://github.com/khitrin/pq-tree-rs).

This library is expected to turn out faster than
[SageMath's PQ Tree](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/graphs/pq_trees.py)
though it is still not done and benchmarking will be done.
